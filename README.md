## This repo provides several jupyter notebooks with which you can learn how to build such a bokeh application

* The folder **A_static_plots** provides you with all basic bokeh knowledge so that you are able to plot and customize static plots
* The folder **B_interactive_plots** is based upon the basic bokeh knowledge and introduces several interactive elements, you can add to make an interactive application out of your static plots! Finally, you will be able to recreate the example from above and build an interactive dashboard with all 250 Pok√©mon from generation 1 & 2
